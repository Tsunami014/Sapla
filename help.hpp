        "<li>The <b>New Note</b> menu button creates a new note</li>"

"<h2>Notes and cards</h2>"
    "<p><i>Notes</i> are blocks of information and <i>cards</i> are a way to view that information.</p>"
    "<p>Cards are created when specific features are added to cards.</p>"
    "<p>For example, you can split your note into a front and a back side with <b>---</b> to separate it into a front and back side</p>"
    "<p>There are some sample cards for you to look at for help.</p>"

"<h2>Escaping</h2>"
    "<p>Sometimes you may want to use things in your notes literally (e.g. <b>---</b>) without it being recognised as a note feature or whatever. "
        "For that, we have backslashes!</p>"
    "<p>All backslashes will be removed from the final text, but you can use this to your advantage. "
        "Using backslashes in places e.g. <b>-\\--</b> will make the feature not parse as a feature!</p>"
    "<p>To get a regular backslash in your text you can escape it; \\\\</p>"
    "<p>Rules for backslashes: place it wherever it works (usually on the <i>inside or middle</i> of features not the outside)</p>"
"<h2>How to use</h2>"
    "<p>You can select notes on the left and edit their contents on the right</p>"
    "<p>There is a bar in the middle you can move left/right to adjust the screen to your needs</p>"
    "<p>Press the 'New note' button in the title to make a new note</p>"
    "<p>Notes can contain things in them that create cards or that affect the text."
        "By default, notes create 0 cards so don't expect them to do stuff unless you add things to them</p>"
    "<p>Things you can add to your notes are in a layout above the note. "
        "Pressing the arrow expands/contracts to see extra. "
        "Pressing the settings button allows you to see all of them at once, and clicking on each will reveal details and help for if you are unsure of what they do.</p>"
    "<p>Below the note input there is a preview. Click on the preview to change side (front vs back) and use the arrows to select between different cards generated by that note. "
        "The preview will display errors that are present in the note too.</p>"
"<h2>Note templates</h2>"
    "<p>Note templates are used in 2 phases - defining them, then using them.</p>"
    "<p>There are some examples of note template uses in the example cards</p>"
    "<h3>Defining note templates</h3>"
        "<p>Note templates are contained within <b>%|</b> and <b>|%</b> and they are made of a header and contents."
            "All extra whitespace around the note templates will be removed. (if you need it use a backslash)</p>"
        "<p>The header is separated from the contents by either a space, <b>|</b> or newline."
            "This is the name to specify when using the note template.</p>"
        "<p>The body will be directly substituted into the text, but can contain arguments via a % and a number, e.g. <b>%1</b>."
            "See below for how they are used when using the template.</p>"
    "<h3>Using note templates</h3>"
        "<p>Note templates uses are surrounded with <b>%%</b>."
            "The arguments are separated by either a <b>|</b> or newline (but the first you can use a space for as well)</p>"
        "<p>The first thing is the name of the card to use, then the arguments to be substituted in order.</p>"
